# Introduction
Tilted Towers has a Server that consists of different classes which contains functions using both networking and multithreading. This is done on a basic level in order to make a functioning game. The game will be running using a server which will be able to be joined by clients. When three clients have typed ip address and port, the game will then start.

# Gameplay instructions
The goal of Tilted Towers is to get the most points which is achieved bybuilding the highest tower. It is played by three people at a time, and each user will be able to spectate the others but will only be able to interact with the middle part of the screen. 

The players will each start with one pre-built towerpiece where they need to place the next towerpiece. A towerpiece will be swinging on the screen, which will fall down when the user presses “space”. The towerpiece has to be dropped so it is on top of the tower, it does not have to be dropped perfectly on top of each other but the further away from the middle the bigger is the chance it will fall down. Everytime a towerpiece is placed correctly the player will gain a point.

Each player will have three lives and will lose one, whenever their own towerpiece is placed too far away from the middle of the tower. A player will lose when all three lives are lost.
